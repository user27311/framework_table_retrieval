The entries inside the Index are directly written and loaded from a file called `index.jsonl`. The path to which we have to specify beforehand, aswell as the directory to which we will want to download the PDF's. The Index is represented as a dictionary which has DOI's as the key and a IndexRow object as a value. A IndexRow consists of a DOI, Status, pdf_path and pdf_url."
